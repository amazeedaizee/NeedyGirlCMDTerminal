This section covers all main commands that you can use in the game.

Each command for the game usually has a main command associated with it.

Each main command usually has more than one way to access it.
Usually in short form such as a single letter representing the
primary key-word.

You can look at what key-words is associated with a main command by 
looking at the title of their commands page.

i.e. COMMAND | C

NOTE: All key-words for commands have to be written in lower-case.
      (with the exception of some, like custom messages)
      The upper-case in the title is just used for emphasis.

For instance, here's what the Notification command looks like:

NOTIFICATION | NOTIF | N: 

Does a command related to notifications.

====================================================================================

> notification

Clicks on the last active notification on the bottom right.

Also exits the epiphany window when it is shown on the screen.

====================================================================================

For the above...

> notification

can also be substituted with...

> notif

or...

> n

To know more about each of them, you can use this command to access 
their respective commands page:

NOTE: I wonder what happens if you press enter in the terminal 
      without any command written down?
      (It just acts as a general button click for moving things along.)
